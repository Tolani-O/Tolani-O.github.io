This is the second half of a two-semester, calculus-based course sequence that introduces theoretical aspects of probability and statistical inference to students. 
The course covers specific probability distributions and their inferential applications, starting with the normal distribution and continuing with the binomial and Poisson distributions, etc., 
and their use in point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and regression. Also covers topics related to multivariate distributions: marginal and conditional distributions, covariance, and conditional distribution moments.
